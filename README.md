# ⚡**EV Adoption Forecasting**  
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners must proactively anticipate infrastructure needs—especially the deployment of ⚡ charging stations. Inadequate planning may lead to congestion, reduced user satisfaction, and setbacks in achieving 🌱 sustainability goals.

### 🧠 **Problem Statement**
Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), create a model to forecast future EV adoption. For example, predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on the trends in the data.

### 🎯 **Goal**
To build a **regression model** that forecasts future electric vehicle (EV) adoption based on:

- 📈 Historical EV growth patterns  
- 🚗 Vehicle type distribution (BEVs and PHEVs)  
- 🗺️ Regional (county-level) data

### **Dataset Description**

This dataset provides monthly vehicle registration data as recorded by the **Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL)**. It includes separate statistics for **passenger vehicles** and **trucks**, segmented by county.

- 🗓️ **Date:** Count of registered vehicles as of the last day of each month  
  *(From 2017-01-31 to 2024-02-29)*  
- 🌍 **County:** Geographic region in Washington where the vehicle owner resides  
- 🏛️ **State:** The associated state or region for the registration record (majority from Washington)  
- 🚙 **Vehicle Primary Use:** Intended use of the vehicle — Passenger (83%) or Truck (17%)  
- 🔋 **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs):** Vehicles powered solely by onboard electric batteries  
- 🔌 **Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs):** Vehicles powered partially by onboard batteries  
- 🚗 **Electric Vehicle Total (EV Total):** Total number of BEVs and PHEVs combined  
- 🛻 **Non-Electric Vehicle Total:** Number of vehicles that are not electric  
- 🚘 **Total Vehicles:** Sum of electric and non-electric vehicles registered in the county  
- 📉 **Percent Electric Vehicles:** Percentage of EVs relative to total vehicle registrations
